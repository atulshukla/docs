Cloud functions are written in `Python` and run in a **video.dev** managed environment, eliminating the need to manage and scale your own servers.

Deployed functions are automatically available as APIs and can also be accessed through the Python client library.

These functions behave like standard Python functions and can be used to create workflows with other cloud functions in the **video.dev** cloud.
